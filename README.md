# EoY-Worldmap

Run index.html. Includes bubble transitions and a primitive play button. Lines 251-265 (commented out) contain the beginnings of hover events, which you can un-comment to view, but which are still problematic.

Known issues/needed fixes: <br>
1. Append text "Play" to play button <br>
2. Play animation is sluggish at first <br>
3. Play animation should be pause-able <br>
4. Mouse hover event needs to end when mouse out <br>
5. Mouse hover event disables slider <br>
5. Append text (updated by city) to rectangle that appears on mouse hover <br>
6. Various styling issues: not all specs are exact yet <br>
7. Heading as per Owen's design
