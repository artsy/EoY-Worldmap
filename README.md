# EoY-Worldmap

Run index.html. Includes bubble transitions and a primitive play button. Lines 251-265 (commented out) contain the beginnings of hover events, which you can un-comment to view, but which are still problematic.

Known issues/needed fixes:
1. Append text "Play" to play button
2. Play animation is sluggish at first
3. Play animation should be pause-able
4. Mouse hover event needs to end when mouse out
5. Mouse hover event disables slider
5. Append text (updated by city) to rectangle that appears on mouse hover
6. Various styling issues: not all specs are exact yet
7. Heading as per Owen's design
