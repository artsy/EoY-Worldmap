      <h1>Contemporary Art’s Most Influential Cities in 2015</h1>
      <p>There are many ways to take stock of influence in the art world, critical reception, popularity, and market prowess among them. As the art world continues to expand, that becomes all the more difficult. We’re in a moment of regionalization&mdash;with art scenes thriving in São Paulo, Singapore, and Istanbul&mdash;as much as we are in one of condensation around the global financial capitals of New York and London, with a core contingent of the art world making a yearly migration, crisscrossing the globe to them all. (Click through the map below to watch the year unfold.) Here, we’ve crunched Planet Art’s data on contemporary art’s most mentioned cities in the media in 2015, pulled figures on fairs, museums, and galleries, and racked our editors’ brains to rank the art world capitals of 2015.</p>
